## Purpose

Yachay is an open-source machine learning community with decades worth of natural language data from media, the dark web, legal proceedings, and government publications. They have cleaned and annotated the data, and created a geolocation detection tool. They are looking for developers interested in contributing and improving on the project. We are given a dataset of tweets, and another dataset of coordinates, upon which we will create a neural network to predict coordinates from text.
