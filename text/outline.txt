# Project Outline

    * take a random sample of the dataset (10,000), save that dataset to work with
    * feature engineer dataset by extracting time data, and text features 
    * process text data with model to get embeddings
    * train model on embeddings alone for baseline
    * append embeddings to dataframe
    * train model on appended dataframe 
    * statistical testing to see if the appended features increased predictions 

# Ideas 

    * collect several samples to workflow, run models on each
    * increase batch size
    * cluster based on language


# Model Evaluation 

    * Target distance in literature is median : 326 km  , mean: 845
    * clusters of the embeddings
